### Hello 👋, I'm Mike Petersen

I am a researcher at the University of Edinburgh -- a member of the Institute for Astronomy, a Stephen Hawking Fellow, and a member of the Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics. I study our Milky Way galaxy and the surrounding environment, hoping to learn something about the nature of dark matter (🤞).
