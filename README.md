### Hello 👋, I'm Mike Petersen

I am a researcher at the University of Edinburgh -- a member of the [Institute for Astronomy](https://ifa.roe.ac.uk), a [Stephen Hawking Fellow](https://www.ukri.org/news/new-stephen-hawking-fellows-announced/), and a member of the [Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk). I study our Milky Way galaxy and the surrounding environment, hoping to learn something about the nature of dark matter (🤞). See more at my [website](https://michael-petersen.github.io)!
